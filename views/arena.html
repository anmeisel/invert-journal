	What's happening here?

	Since we passed the contents of the are.na channel we fetched to the render, we can
	access it using *sections* (https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html#Sections)

		((# arena ))
			(( key ))
		((/ arena ))

		^ In this example, if `key` exists inside `arena`, it will render every instance
		of `key` *for each* object/block.

	(note that you will need to use CURLY BRACKETS, not normal ones in the example above,
	we will not use them here for fear of rendering the arena channel contents JSON here
	in this comment!!!! lol)

	We then construct a huge ~if/else statement for each block to render different blocks
	of HTML based on what type of block it is (text, image, link, embed, attachment, etc.)

	From here, we can style each type of block how we want using CSS.
	
	Note that mustache doesn't support true if/else statements, so some more complex
	block types (attachments/files), might need to be handled with javascript (eg. playing
	videos). Usually the best way to reference these is by rendering the block `id` into
	the block somewhere, and then rendering the same block `id` as a target in your js
